# The Art of Emergence Â®

A digital space I made to demonstrate one of my personal most important principles of design.

## Description

"A lot of designers don't talk about this particular principle of design animation principle, and it's of great importance as companies like [Apple](https://www.apple.com/) and [Google](https://www.google.com/) and Some designers like [Camille Mormal](https://camillemormal.com/) and [Dennis Snellenberg](https://dennissnellenberg.com/) use it Alot."
